# Voice Orchestrator (`apps/voice/call-automation/`)

> Owner agent: A10-Voice — see `governance/agents/A10-voice.md`
> Status: implemented (Phase A complete)

## Purpose

Bridges three Azure components into a single low-latency citizen voice channel:

```
PSTN caller ─► ACS Call Automation ─► Voice Orchestrator ─► GPT-4o Realtime
                                            │
                                            ├──► Foundry topic-router (function tool)
                                            └──► D365 voice workstream (warm transfer)
```

| Concern              | Component                                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Telephony            | Azure Communication Services Call Automation (PSTN, SIP, WebRTC)    |
| Speech (STT/TTS/VAD) | Azure OpenAI **GPT-4o Realtime** (one stream, native Whisper STT)   |
| Brain                | Foundry **topic-router** agent (`/agents/topic-router/messages`)    |
| Human handoff        | Dynamics 365 **Voice Channel** workstream (warm transfer)           |
| Recording + récap    | ACS recording → Dataverse `callTranscript` → Fabric + Confidential Ledger anchor |

## Why this shape and not Bot Framework / MAF for the audio path?

* **Bot Framework SDK reaches end-of-life on 31 December 2025.** All net-new Microsoft voice + agent work is on the **Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)** + M365 Agents SDK. We follow that direction for any *turn-based* agent surface.
* **But voice with GPT Realtime is not turn-based.** It is a continuous bidirectional audio stream with server-side VAD and barge-in. Microsoft's own canonical sample (`Azure-Samples/acs-azopenai-voice-integration`) connects ACS Call Automation directly to the Realtime WebSocket — no Bot Framework or MAF in the audio path. We adopt that pattern.
* **MAF still earns its keep.** The Foundry topic-router agent is itself an MAF-hosted agent reached over the same `/agents/topic-router/messages` HTTP contract that the chat widget uses. The voice orchestrator just exposes that agent to GPT Realtime as a *function tool*. One brain, three channels (chat, voice, copilot).

## Routes

| Method | Path                                       | Purpose                                                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/healthz`                                 | Liveness + readiness                                     |
| POST   | `/api/acs/eventgrid`                       | Event Grid `IncomingCall` (handles validation handshake) |
| POST   | `/api/acs/callbacks`                       | ACS Call Automation lifecycle events                     |
| WS     | `/api/acs/media?nonce={single-use-token}`   | Nonce-authenticated bidirectional media stream from ACS   |

## Function tools exposed to GPT Realtime

| Tool                  | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lookup_topic_router` | Calls APIM `/agents/topic-router/messages` with `{channel: 'voice', locale, text}`; result drives the spoken answer. If the agent flips `escalate=true`, we also invoke `transferToD365Caseworker`. |
| `escalate_to_human`   | Direct citizen request, sensitive topic, or DTMF `0`; warm-transfers to the country D365 voice workstream queue with an `udcspEscalation` JSON context the caseworker sees on screen.    |
| `end_call_with_recap` | Sends an SMS récap (best-effort, via the SMS templates) and hangs up.                                                                                                                    |

## Configuration

All wiring is environment-driven so secrets stay in Key Vault and the same image runs in DK/SE/NO. Required variables are listed in `src/config.ts`; the Bicep template injects them automatically, including `ACS_RESOURCE_ID` for Call Automation webhook JWT validation. `isLiveMode()` returns `false` until ACS, OpenAI, APIM and D365 endpoints are populated, which keeps `npm run dev` safe locally.

Structured events go to Application Insights only. `VOICE_UNSAFE_DEBUG_LOGGING=true` additionally mirrors telemetry and exception details to the console; it is off by default and must not be enabled in production because console output can expose sensitive call data.

## Local development

```pwsh
cd apps/voice/call-automation
npm install
npm run lint
npm test
npm run dev   # Express on :8080; WS upgrade on /api/acs/media
```

## Deployment

```pwsh
./scripts/Deploy-Voice.ps1 -Country no -Env dev
./scripts/Bind-AcsNumber.ps1 -Country no -Env dev
./scripts/Test-Voice.ps1 -Country no -Env dev
```

These scripts call the Bicep templates here and then bind the procured PSTN numbers from `apps/voice/acs/phone-number-bindings.yaml` to this orchestrator's Event Grid subscription.
