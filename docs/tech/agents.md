# UDCSP — Multi-Agent Build Log

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Historical execution log.** Records *who built what, with which model, in how much wall-clock time*. Useful for reproducibility and cost analysis ; not a source of truth for the current architecture (see [`architecture.md`](./architecture.md)) or for current install steps (see [`installation.md`](./installation.md)).


> Execution log of the parallel multi-agent build that produced the **UDCSP** platform scaffolding.
>
> This document is the **operational counterpart** to [`plan.md`](./plan.md): plan.md declares *who builds what, in which order*; agents.md records *who built what, with which model, in how much wall-clock time, and where the output landed*.

## 1. Build philosophy

The 17 agents declared in [plan.md §2](./plan.md#2-agent-roster--responsibilities) (A0 → A16) were collapsed into **6 vertical sub-agents** for delivery. Each vertical owns 2-4 plan-agents whose outputs converge into one folder family.

| Vertical sub-agent | Plan agents owned | Folders owned |
|---|---|---|
| `agent-platform` | A1, A2, A3, A5 | `infra/` |
| `agent-data-gov` | A4, A13 | `data/fabric/`, `governance/purview/`, `governance/ai-act/` |
| `agent-foundry` | A6, A11, A12, A15 | `foundry/`, `apps/web/i18n/`, `data/synthetic/` *(was also `apps/copilot-studio/` before the post-audit refactor folded it into `foundry/agents/topic-router/`)* |
| `agent-services` | A7, A8 | `services/`, `apps/d365/` |
| `agent-frontend` | A9, A10 | `apps/web/` (excl. i18n), `apps/mobile/`, `apps/voice/` |
| `agent-qa` | A14 | `tests/` |
| **orchestrator (this CLI)** | A0, A16 | `installation.md`, `recipe.md`, `agents.md`, `scripts/install/`, `scripts/cleanup/`, `scripts/dev/`, `.github/workflows/` |

This collapse keeps **strict isolation by folder** (no two agents write to overlapping paths), so all six can run **fully in parallel**.

## 2. Parallel execution

  section Orchestrator
  installer + docs   :o1, 00:00:30, 8m
```

**Wall-clock** (longest single sub-agent — `agent-platform` at 11 min 5 s — running concurrently with the orchestrator's docs/installer work): **≈ 12 minutes**.
**Sequential equivalent** (sum of every sub-agent's duration): **45 min 47 s** (665 + 602 + 446 + 435 + 361 + 238 seconds).
**Parallelism factor:** **4.13×** for the sub-agent fan-out alone, **~5×** end-to-end including orchestrator work that ran concurrently.

The orchestrator (this CLI session) writes the installer, master docs and CI plumbing **concurrently** with the sub-agents, because none of those artefacts depend on sub-agent output (they reference paths / contracts only).

## 4. Token & request accounting (estimated)

> Sub-agent invocations report only wall-clock + final result; the `task` tool does not surface per-agent token counts. The estimates below are derived from prompt size, observed output file count and average file size.

| Sub-agent | Files produced | Prompt tokens | Output tokens (est.) | Tool calls (est.) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `agent-data-gov`     |  64 | ~2 800 | ~22 000 | ~80 |
| `agent-foundry`      | 142 | ~3 600 | ~52 000 | ~180 |
| `agent-frontend`     | 103 | ~3 500 | ~38 000 | ~135 |
| `agent-qa`           |  89 | ~3 200 | ~32 000 | ~115 |
| `agent-services`     | 102 | ~3 400 | ~38 000 | ~135 |
| `agent-platform`     |  64 | ~3 200 | ~28 000 | ~95 |
| **subtotal sub-agents** | **564** | **~19 700** | **~210 000** | **~740** |
| Orchestrator (this session) |  39 | ~28 000 | ~42 000 | ~80 |
| **TOTAL initial build**            | **603** | **~47 700** | **~252 000** | **~820** |

The orchestrator carries the **largest prompt budget** (full plan / architecture / case study + every sub-agent result + every checkpoint) but a moderate output volume (installer, master docs, status updates).

## 4-bis. Post-audit refactor run (May 2026)

A second multi-agent run was launched on top of the initial scaffold to apply the architectural audit recommendations: **suppress** Azure SQL DB, Cosmos DB, Microsoft Copilot Studio and citizen-facing Power BI Embedded; **add** Microsoft Entra Verified ID, Microsoft Priva, Azure Confidential Ledger, Azure Confidential Compute, Microsoft Defender for APIs, Azure DDoS Protection Standard, Azure Backup + Site Recovery, Azure Chaos Studio, Azure Bastion (Standard) and Microsoft Entra Permissions Management (CIEM). The full diff and rationale are in [`plan_post_audit.md`](./plan_post_audit.md).

```

- **Wall-clock for the post-audit refactor**: ≈ 17 minutes (longest sub-agent `sa6-priva-gdpr` at 9 min, fully overlapped with orchestrator's installer/docs work, plus the orchestrator's post-merge finalization).
- **Sequential equivalent for the post-audit refactor**: 46 min 28 s (sub-agents only) + ≈ 17 min orchestrator = **≈ 63 min 28 s**.
- **Parallelism factor (post-audit only)**: ≈ **3.7×**.

### 4-bis.4 Cumulative — initial build + post-audit refactor + voice runtime

| Run | Wall-clock | Sequential equivalent | Parallelism factor |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Initial build (multi-agent scaffolding, May 2026) | **≈ 12 min** | **≈ 45 min 47 s** | **~5×** end-to-end |
| Post-audit refactor (May 2026) | **≈ 17 min** | **≈ 63 min 28 s** | **~3.7×** end-to-end |
| Voice runtime end-to-end (May 2026) — `apps/voice/call-automation/` (8 src + 3 bicep + 3 ps1 + APIM API + module + 2 vitest specs + readme + `voice.md` § 11 rewrite) | **≈ 14 min** | **≈ 38 min** | **~2.7×** orchestrator-led |
| **Cumulative (sum of wall-clock)** | **≈ 43 min** | **≈ 147 min 15 s** | **~3.4×** weighted average |

> **Reading note.** The "cumulative wall-clock" is the developer's lived clock-on-the-wall: how long the human was waiting on the multi-agent system to deliver. The "sequential equivalent" is what an unparallelised run of the same work would have cost. The platform — IaC, apps, foundry, governance, security, BCDR, post-audit refactor, **voice runtime code end-to-end (PSTN ↔ ACS Call Automation ↔ GPT-4o Realtime ↔ Foundry topic-router as a function tool, with D365 warm-transfer wired but gated behind a D365_VOICE_QUEUE_ID env var — Demo 2 v1 runs no-handoff until D365 Customer Service is provisioned)**, all docs in 12 sections each — is therefore delivered in **under 45 wall-clock minutes** of agent compute, against a ≈ 2 h 27 min sequential baseline.

### 4-bis.5 Voice runtime breakdown (May 2026)

| Sub-task | Output | Files | Tools used |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Architecture decision | Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF) vs Bot Framework SDK (rejected — deprecated end-2025) vs direct ACS Call Automation + GPT-4o Realtime as a Foundry function tool (chosen); justified in §11.2 of `docs/biz/voice.md` | 0 (decision) | web search, github search |
| Source files | `src/{config,logger,ivr-loader,foundry-tool,d365-handoff,realtime-bridge,call-handler,index}.ts` | 8 | create |
| Bicep | `infra/{voice-orchestrator,event-grid-incoming-call,gpt-realtime-deployment}.bicep` | 3 | create + `az bicep build` |

## 6. Observed cross-agent contracts

Recorded by the sub-agents themselves at hand-off; resolved during orchestrator finalisation.

| Producer | Consumer | Contract | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agent-data-gov` (`governance/ai-act/registry/*.yaml`) | `agent-foundry` (`foundry/agents/*/agent.yaml > registryEntryRef`) | Stable registry entry IDs | IDs fixed: `eligibility-model`, `classifier-model`, `citizen-assistant`, `translator`, `doc-extractor`, plus `caseworker-helper` (added in finalisation) |
| `agent-foundry` (`apps/web/i18n/messages/{lang}.json`) | `agent-frontend` (`apps/web/src/main.tsx`) | 12-language ICU catalogue with stable keys | Frontend imports from `apps/web/i18n/messages/` directly |
| `agent-services` (`services/apim/apis/*/openapi.yaml`) | `agent-frontend` (`apps/{web,mobile}/src/api/*.ts`) | OpenAPI 3 contracts | Web/mobile clients written against the contract; can be regenerated from spec |
| `agent-services` (D365 case-create connector) | `agent-foundry` (`foundry/agents/topic-router/connections/d365-escalation.json`) *(post-audit: previously `apps/copilot-studio/connections/d365-case-create.json`)* | Dataverse Web API schema for `udcsp_application` | Connector JSON references the table; D365 solution declares it |
| `agent-data-gov` (Fabric mirroring sink) | `agent-services` (Dataverse → Fabric mirroring) | Mirror config destination workspace per country | `data/fabric/workspaces/workspace-config.json` × `apps/d365/dataverse-to-fabric-mirroring/mirror-config.json` |
| `agent-platform` (External ID URLs, Key Vault names) | All agents that call External ID / read secrets | Per-country External ID authority URLs + bootstrap KV name | Centralised in `scripts/install/config/udcsp.config.template.psd1` |

---

## 7. Open TODOs requiring a real tenant

These are deliberate placeholders in the scaffolds; resolving them is the job of an actual tenant install.

- External ID tenant IDs, client IDs, redirect URIs (`infra/identity/`, `apps/web/src/auth/msalConfig.ts`)
- Foundry workspace endpoint, model deployment names, content-safety endpoint (`scripts/install/config/udcsp.config.psd1`)
- D365 environment URLs (template provided, real values needed)
- ACS toll-free phone numbers per country (`apps/voice/acs/phone-numbers.bicep`)
- Real-language translations (current i18n catalogues are draft / machine-style)
- Power BI tenant for report publication
- Purview account name + capacity
- eIDAS sandbox endpoints for cross-border identity tests
- GitHub OIDC federation to Azure for the `installer-validate` workflow

Each TODO is annotated in-place with `// TODO: case-study scaffold` so an installer can grep them all.

---

## 8. Risks observed during build

| # | Risk | Mitigation taken |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sub-agents writing to overlapping folders | Strict folder isolation declared in each prompt; no overlaps observed |
| 2 | Inconsistent registry IDs between Foundry agents and AI Act registry | Orchestrator finalisation cross-checks; mismatches fixed during plan-update phase |
| 3 | i18n key drift between frontend and translation pipeline | Both reference the same `apps/web/i18n/messages/{lang}.json`; `Validate-Translations.ps1` runs as part of installer Test-Apps |
| 4 | Installer module references missing test scripts | Each `Test-*` PSM1 verb checks `Test-Path` on its component-owned test script and throws if missing |
| 5 | Sub-agent fails / stalls | Orchestrator re-runs the affected vertical or completes its scope manually (none required this run) |

---

## 9. How to re-run the build

To regenerate the entire scaffold from a clean repository (without re-running the case-study definition phase):

```powershell
# Re-launch all 6 vertical sub-agents from the orchestrator session:
# (See the prompts at tail of agents.md, kept verbatim for reproducibility.)
```

Sub-agent prompts are deliberately self-contained and stateless; they reference `plan.md`, `architecture.md`, `case-study-11.md`, `uses.md` for full context.

---

## 10. Sub-agent prompts (for reproducibility)

Each prompt is large (~3-4 KB), so they are referenced by their sub-agent ID. To re-spawn a vertical, copy the corresponding prompt from the build conversation and re-launch via the `task` tool with `agent_type: "general-purpose"`, `mode: "background"`. The prompts encode:

- absolute working-directory path
- full deliverables list with absolute file paths
- contract for "done" (each component must include README + smoke script)
- explicit out-of-scope folders (so two agents never collide)
- conventions (naming, tagging, multilingual scope, security baseline)
- prohibition on `git commit` / `git push` / writing to root `*.md`
